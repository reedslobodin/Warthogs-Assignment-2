; ONE PARAGRAPH WRITE-UP
; Throughout designing our program, we would have many ideas but eventually we would all end up pursuing
; our own ways to process the notes in the song in order to get them to play through the code. One idea
; that seemed to stick was to define each note and then append the notes in each measure in order to play
; them. We would also develop a function tat converted seconds into beats in order to make it easier for us
; to define lengths of notes and to check our work. The way we would check our work was to make sure the beats
; added up to four in every measure. We would then develop a play-note function to play our notes all based
; around the sound made from the (synth-note "main" 12 note-number (beats beat))) sound using our note-numbers
; based on the notes we had defined earlier basing them on additions of our octave, or 0. We would then also use
; our seconds to beats function inside of this to show the length of our note. We would then append these notes to
; make the measures and eventually build all of those together to create the song. That would be the way I personally
; went about the process to develop my code. However, I know that others would use lines or spaces to define what
; notes were being played and they would also use seconds to define their note length. We also had some ideas to
; build on this program, such as interactive aspects you could add to this program. Such as adding key presses
; that could pause the song, play the song faster, slower, or at a different volume. Currently the program is split
; into five parts, part 1 being founding definitions to use in the next four parts, which were then the parts of the
; song we had split up and assigned each team member to write the code for. Each part was 2 staffs, with the exception
; of the last staff which had some extra measures. We hope you enjoy our coded version of Violin 2!
